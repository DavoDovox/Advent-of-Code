# [Advent-of-Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
I created this repo to share my solutions to Advent of Code's problems, don't expect them to be optimal solutions. I do it for fun and not to compete with others.
# How this code is produced and tested:
I write the code in Notepad++ and compile it through cmd using GCC version 11.2.0.
